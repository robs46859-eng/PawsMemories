 * Deliberately exactly four. The header previously carried ten controls on the
 * right (Pet Health, Store, Community, theme, profile, PupCoins, help, two
 * admin buttons, logout), which is why nothing in it read as primary. Retired
 * panels remain in source but are not routed; supported secondary controls live
 * in the profile overflow menu.
 *
 * "Stencil" here means stroke-only lucide glyphs at a uniform 1.75 stroke
 * width, no fills and no pill/border chrome. Active state is carried by colour
 * and a dot, not by a filled background, so all four stay visually equal
 * weight. `screens` lists every route that should light the icon — the Create
 * flow spans five screens and must not go dark mid-flow.
